## Hi there 👋

Network & System Infrastructure Engineer

Focusing on enterprise network architecture, BGP routing optimization, and transitioning towards Cloud automation for Orange. 

* Most of my daily engineering work (Terraform, Ansible, AWS/GCP config) is locked behind enterprise private repositories.
* I use this small public profile to share my personnal network utility scripts, cron jobs, and lab benchmarks (and network labs in the futur).
* Currently preparing for CCNP certification

**Core Stack:**
* **Networking:** Cisco IOS-XE, Fortinet SD-WAN, Juniper, BGP/OSPF
* **Automation:** Python (Netmiko, NAPALM), Ansible, Terraform and CI/CD..
* **Cloud & FinOps:** AWS (EKS, VPC Transit Gateways), Cost Modeling and Assessment
